# Openshift DIY-Python template
This is a openshift DIY-template which installs python, pip and the requirements defines in `$OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR/requirements.txt` and then starts `$OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR/server.py`.
This template can be used to enable the use of websockets with python.

Note: This template has not been tested with Openshift 3.
